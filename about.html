            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
              This website's whole goal is to bring people that are 
              interested in Computer Science and unite as a whole. 
              Not only that, but also give an opportunity for other 
              people to see what the Computer Science world is like 
              and join the community! Give it a try and see what the Computer
              Science field has to offer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>What is needed to join?</h1>
            <p>
              Anyone can join the community. Do not worry if you do not 
              possess the necessary skills in order to participate Computer 
              Science tasks. Most believe mathematical skills are needed the 
              most in order to be successful in the Computer Science field.
              However, and article with the name of “Unravelling 
              the Numerical and Spatial Underpinnings of Computational 
              Thinking: a Pre-Registered Replication Study.” proves otherwise
              with evidence given. This article is from a peer-reviewed academic
              journal: give it a read if interested!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Which path to start?</h1>
            <p>
              Start by picking which path seems interesting to you!
              Instead of starting from the beginning learning simple Computer
              Science, try starting from your chosen path and goal.
              I got this interesting idea from the article, 
              “The Case for Alternative Endpoints in Computing Education.""
              which is also from a peer-reviewed journal. Read this one as well
              if you are intersted!
