            <h1>What are some mistakes us programmers make?</h1>
            <p>
                The article talks about how there is a high percentage rate 
                of softwares having erros due to their structure which is the coding itself.
                The article states that these issues can be fixed by avoiding the same 
                mistakes as others make and prove our coding skills.
                If the percentage of errors within a software is high,the percentage 
                to recover that software is also extremly high. For 
                this reason, improving the resiliency of a computer system 
                without using an external redundancy and hardware modification 
                can be done by simply fixing the errors in the code. 
                The article gives side-effects of producing bad coding that
                comes with errors, and also provides expiraments of 
                programming structures and their chances of having erros.

            <h2>Self reflect</h2>
            <p>
                As I am still learning how to program and code, I Will
                make many mistakes in my journey. For those as well that are 
                learning, do not feel bad when you make a mistake. Rather, learn 
                from that mistake, and as the article says, improve your skills on
                coding.
